### Backend Pre-requisites

To install Python, please download go to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda is a package manager for Python, but does not contain all packages.
Anaconda will most likely not have the flask libraries so to ensure that you get them. 
```
pip install Flask
```

Type the following in the terminal window. I recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as an IDE.


### Database Pre-requisites

Make sure you have a database visualization tool. I recommend [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). Go to the Wiki for the credentials to connect the PostgreSQL database.

### Testing API Calls

I recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to test the API calls to the backend.
